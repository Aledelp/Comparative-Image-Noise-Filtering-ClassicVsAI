# Comparative-Image-Noise-Filtering-ClassicVsAI
This is the code I work with during the developing of myt "TFG". Please if you need the data to try the code download 
it at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u5cljIdlI6KEHsR09jZ6cihLSXGWizmS?usp=sharing 
It contains the three group of .nib images necessary and the model to upload (be careful if you try to re-train it again, it would consume your GPU space).
To try it, just upload the files to your colaboratoty and change routes as necessary.
